# AB Testing (Independent Two-Sample T-Test)

Hypothesis: Statistical methods used to test a belief or a claim. The subject we will cover within the scope of hypothesis testing will be group comparisons.
The main purpose of group comparisons is to try to show whether possible differences arise by chance.

AB Tests: It is used when it is desired to make a comparison between the two group averages. 

Two mean values or two ratios are compared with AB tests (A: Experimental group, B: Control Group).

1. Establish Hypotheses
2. Assumption Check
    - 1. Normality Assumption
    - 2. Variance Homogeneity
  3. Application of the Hypothesis
    - 1. Independent two-sample t-test (parametric test) if assumptions are met
    - 2. Mannwhitneyu test if assumptions are not provided (non-parametric test)
  4. Interpret results based on p-value
